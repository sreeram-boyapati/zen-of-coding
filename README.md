# Zen of Coding

1. Concurrency is a lie. Parallelism is reality.
2. Complex Tasks are achieved by simple code.
3. Computers are what we make them.
4. Bugs are our mistakes and we learn from them to acheive perfection.
5. Patience and Logic are our tools.
6. Repetition is a disease and automation is the cure.
7. We donot write what we do not speak.
8. If ElseIf is better than if else.

#### We are the practitioners of discrete logic.
